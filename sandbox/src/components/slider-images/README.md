# Notes:

- It is very important to provide a meaningful short title/label for each slide in the `data-slide-label` attribute. This label will be used as a tab title for the dot navigation and will be shown on hover.
- The title of each dot is shown on hover and focus to make it possible for users of voice dictation to select and interact with the dot.
- Labels should be short and succinct. They're not meant to be long decsriptions like the image description, for example.
